## raft-rs

Welcome to my implementation of the raft consensus algorithm derived from [the raft paper](http://nil.csail.mit.edu/6.824/2018/papers/raft-extended.pdf) 

The plan for this project is to be used in conjunction with my trie data structure and libp2p to provide a fault tolerant persistant state machine.
The fault model aimed for is crash fault tolerant.
